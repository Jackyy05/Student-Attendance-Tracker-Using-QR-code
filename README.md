## Students Attendance Using QR Code
This is a python script! Using this script you can mark attendance using QR Codes. You just have to enter the name of the students in students.txt file and run the generate.py file, which will generate QR code for all the mentioned students. Then you just have to run the Attendance.py file that will trigger your webcam which will be used to scan the codes. Thank You!
